## Description

You have been asked to develop a website for a local Veterinarian practice. This project should be coded using ASP.NET in an IDE such as Visual Studio or VS Code.

The website is a basic shop front type website to promote the Vetâ€™s business. You are provided with information about the Vet and some other resources to complete this task. The Vet is a dog specialist but does treat other suburban pets. The Vet does not have any rural clients although is happy to see farm class animals as required.

The client would like to a simple site - around 4 pages, but happy if more are required for your design.

1.        A title page with the Business information with links to the other 3 pages.

2.        The Second page is about its people and their Biographies.

3.        The third page is about the services provided.

4.        The last page has the location information and a map.

The client, who is a dog specialist, would also like each dog owner to be able to add an account to become a member of the website.

The account creation process will collect:

First name, Surname, contact phone number, email address, suburb, postcode, pet name, pet breed, pet age, pet gender.
